Using K Nearest Neighbours clustering for classification, we perform voter classification (Trump v/s Clinton) with 2016 data, i.e., given some information about the voters' data, we select appropriate features which can best predict whether the voter will vote for Trump or Clinton. 

Given demographic data about a voter and their opinions on certain key issues, can we predict their vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election? We will attempt this using a K nearest neighbor classifier.
